# PHP-TTT-NeuralNet
A neural net with genetic algorithm that learns to play tic tac toe


This is a small experiment with genetic algorithms and neural networks that I worked on out of boredom and interest.

It implements a TIC-TAC-TOE game and a Training class which is used to train the genetic algorithm (the players "brain") in different ways.

There are 3 possible variants:

Let the genetic players play against...

1 - a random algorithm that just picks a random valid move each time.

2 - a minimax algorithm which basically should never loose and at least play a draw

3 - another genetic neural net


PS: Still have to clean up some parts of the code. It looks really messy at sometimes.
